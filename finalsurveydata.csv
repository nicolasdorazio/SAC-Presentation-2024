How can you expect high school—16 total classes—to eat in one period but split up 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th grade—each 6 classes—into different periods? The schedule last year was absolutely fine, and from a student’s stand point, there is no reason to fix what isn’t broken. By attempting to do so, administration has only created an artificial issue. Additionally, just because food is allowed throughout the day does not mean that people have food to eat. Being hungry is not the only factor hindering learning performance either. Having 5 straight periods in a row without a break is arguably even more impactful. Finally, the issue about leaving early for sports has historically never been a significant issue for Masterman students because of the academic culture. Students understand that any missed work must be made up on their own time, and teachers were very understanding.

It's frustrating voicing our concerns for Dr. Payne to ignore it and just say she's doing her best. She's not. At the assembly/meeting, she didn't answer many of the questions. Instead of truly listening to what we were saying, she would go around the question or just deny it. Stop interfering with what you think is best when you have only been here for three years.

My advisor teacher seems uncomfortable for the same reason. The school is forcing us! So I try my best to opt out and stay silent. Compromise- Do the SEL stuff in regular classes, bc those teachers teach and know me. The advisors, unless they actually teach their whole advisory, don't have time to build normal relationships with their advisees given the way MHS works.

There are still a few here that qualify in that regard, but several who did left-are no longer here. I call my theory trickle-down-our administrators don't bet to know the school/the teachers, there is a pressure their, and then it trickles down from the teachers to us. Outside, generic solutions are not working, but they keep being forced on us since the pandemic.",8 period regular schedule with a Short advisory with more Specials periods,8 period regular schedule with short morning advisory and a flexible 8th period like Pathways,Short morning advisory everyday,"Again, I don't need Advisory every day. I'm also trying to be on my phone less, and seeing all my classmates on their phones during Advisory isn't helping. Come up with other solutions and outlets for students who need emotional support.

In that regard, I feel even more sorry for the middle-schoolers. It's nice that there are all these clubs. It's a great feature, but maybe lunch should just be for lunch. There's a rushed feel to the clubs. I don't like it when club leaders just post on Google Clasrrom, come to this room now for club. It's rude, and poor/thoughless leadership.

Just the fact you're asking those questions shows there is something wrong with leadership here. I can't say I personally know them, but I know I was happier and more excited about MHS before they came. That was the return to school after virtual learning year. I would also say there's a lack of authority in the school. Who do I look up to to tell me what is right and wrong what is appropriate and inappropriate? Certainly not them! Remember when Middle School Tea tiktok was a problem? That's just one of MANY examples of look the other c way culture at Masterman. I want adults who actually model good behavior. I see few =(

As a senior that takes 3 AP courses, I find it very difficult to keep up with all my classes plus another course that turned out to have a huge courseload (lots of tests, projects, and weekly assignments that are very long). I specifically did not take any science courses this year because that is not at all what I plan to study in college (business and economics) and I feel like I was cornered into taking this course. I was very excited to take no science courses and I am very happy with all my courses, but Forensics feels like an extra class that assigns so much work. Furthermore, as a senior I am also sending mid-year and final grades to colleges and I am afraid that Forensics is going to drag down my GPA (out of all my AP courses it is my lowest grade because it is hard to keep up with all my courses and all of the busywork and tests in Forensics)."

Now, I have lunch after all 5 of my core classes, which means I have to sit through 5 consecutive class periods (over 4 hours) with no break in between. Not only is this exhausting, it is difficult to be fully prepared for 5 back-to-back classes, and to process 5 completely different sets of information with no break to let anything sink in or work/think further.",I am a high school student and I do not know,Strongly Disagree,4,1,5,40 mins,I like the 8 period regular schedule we used previously,"I truly have nothing positive to say about the new bell schedule. Frankly, it really sucks for us students and it's a major, major downgrade from what we had in previous years.

For the A/B schedule: It's impossible to keep track of ""what day it is,"" and it's even harder to determine club scheduling when you have to remember not only what day it is, but what number of that day it is. It's also frustrating that our school schedules can no longer be coordinated with our outside schedules, such as knowing what classes I will be missing when I have a doctor's appointment, or knowing that I have room for more after-school commitments on certain days because I can get work done in senior seminar.

For the 7 period schedule: Pathways actually ended up being an incredibly valuable resource last year, and no longer having it has made things much more difficult. For starters, giving high school students a free period when middle school students had guidance allowed for more MS/HS connection, particularly through groups like Peer Counseling and QSA/Prisms, as well as making things like tutoring easier. These things have now shifted to the end-of-day advisory period, but not only is this 10 minutes shorter than Pathways was, which makes a significant difference, doing these activities now means that all students involved have to miss their own advisory. Advisory is an important time for connecting with peers and receiving important information/forms/etc. from advisors. Having advisory and pathways be two separate periods meant that we could do in-school activities at the end of the day and still get all the important benefits of going to advisory, but now that these activities are forced to be during advisory, most seniors rarely, if ever, go to advisory, and I would imagine the same is true for the rest of the high school. This makes it much more difficult to communicate information to all students, or to have important group discussions, and I think our community is generally weaker because of it.

For advisory being at the end of the day: I really appreciated having advisory in the morning because it allowed me to collect myself and get in the school mindset before going to class, as well as talk to my classmates and look over materials for any exams that day so they were fresh in my mind. Getting to school and having to go straight to class feels very jarring, and I feel like I am not ready to start class at 8:15, yet I'm forced to anyway, which decreases the quality of my learning. Also, I liked being able to sit in advisory at 7:50 or 8:00 when I got to school, but now I have to awkwardly wait in the hallway until 8:15, because at least in the library, we're not allowed to go into class until then. With advisory being at the beginning of the day, the period from around 7:45 to 8:15 was still sort of advisory, but now, that period is nothing, and it seems like no one knows what to do with it. As a result, large groups of students just stand in the hall outside every classroom starting at 8:00 or so, which makes it much harder to navigate the building, but also much harder to use that time productively: if I had access to a desk, I could get something done in those 10 or 15 minutes, but instead I just stand and go on my phone because there isn't really room to do work. Finally, I am usually on time to school, but arriving late for whatever reason happens sometimes, and I liked that advisory was sort of a buffer for that; now, if I'm even a few minutes late to school, I'm automatically missing class time, which is harmful, and quite frustrating.",8 period regular schedule with a Short advisory with more Specials periods,8 period regular schedule with short morning advisory and a flexible 8th period like Pathways,Long morning extended advisory everyday,"Advisory in the morning is SIGNIFICANTLY preferable to advisory in the afternoon.

I get to go over my homework most of the time when we aren't doing anything and communicate with others and ask for help on my homework when I don't understand. This helps me because I don't have to struggle and I am able to ask a teacher instead of doing it myself and not understanding.

I understand that the weather is not always acceptable but if students aren't allowed to go out on a day that they are able to play their sport, but the next day they are able to, they should be able to have a make up day. I feel this is unfair if you don't allow make-up days because some kids look forward to recess on the roof because it may be the only time they have access to play or even interact with others in a way they enjoy. Personally, I don't really have access to playing outside and do a sport I enjoy due to my schedule so everyday I look forward to going on the roof to play volleyball with my friends since it is something I enjoy. So whenever it is unexpectedly not allowed that day (sometimes even if the weather is acceptable) I get disappointed.
